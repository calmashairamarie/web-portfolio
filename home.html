		<p class="about">  "I have been in the customer service industry for the past five years. My most recent experience has been handling incoming calls in the high tech industry. One reason I particularly enjoy this business, and the challenges that go along with it, is the opportunity to connect with people. In my last job, I formed some significant customer relationships resulting in a 30 percent increase in sales in a matter of months.What I am looking for now is a company that values customer relations, where I can join a strong team and have a positive impact on customer retention and sales."</p>
